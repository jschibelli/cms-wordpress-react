This code creates a services page that displays three cards using Material UI. Each card has a title, description, and a button with different labels for each service.

You can customize the appearance of the cards by using various props available in the Material UI library. For example, you can change the color of the button or add an icon to it.

Please note that this is just a basic example and you will likely want to add more functionality and styling to your services page depending on your specific needs. [/INST]
