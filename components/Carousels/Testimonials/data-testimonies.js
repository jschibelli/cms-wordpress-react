John took the time to hire a team of instructors, including myself, who's skills and personalities complimented each other. This proved to be an excellent strategy as it meant the team was stronger and worked much better together. John always promoted our development and worked hard to make sure the resources were available for us to do so. He is very well organized, creative, and has excellent leadership skills. It was a pleasure working with him.",
